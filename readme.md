# 211 Project

![image](https://jooinn.com/images/coding-and-programming-computer-science-and-it.jpg)

## Premise

Build a gradebook application to interpret course grades into catagorical totals and semester final grade.

## Purpose

Knowing your grade throughout the term is one of the most critical tools you have at your disposal as a student. Without this knowledge, it becomes incredibly difficult to assess your knowledge of the subject matter relative to a course. It also means not knowing where you stand in a course and more importantly whether you may truly need help or not.

This project, when successfully compiled, will alleviate that concern for this course. An effective output will provide merely a course grade calculated based on all possible points that can be earned within the course.

*Note: I'm not looking for fancy, I'm looking for effective, clean code.*

## Requirements

Choose a group
- [ ] Form a group of 3-4 members

Program
- [ ] Write a program to successfully evaluate individual deliverables from CSC 212 to provide an accurate output of semester course grades. Viewable outputs should include:
- [ ] individual: returns an individual deliverable name and grade
- [ ] category: returns all grades from the category and category total
- [ ] course: ability to return each of the following:
  - all grades within their respective categories and a course overall
  - only category totals and course overall
  - only the course overall
- [ ] clear, conscientious comments embedded within the your code
- [ ] successfully compiles accurate output
- [ ] use read input to take in grades from an external file
- [ ] use write output to write any changes back to your input file

Repository
- [ ] a _primary_ repository to house your program
- proof of contribution
  - [ ] `commit` and `push` actions made by each group member

Report
- [ ] a brief summary of the project
- [ ] evidence of planning:
  - pseudocode/flowcharts
  - *note: anything other than pseudocode/flowcharts will not be accepted*
- [ ] provide detailed instructions for compiling/using your program
  - command line arguments
  - function/method calls
  - etc...
- [ ] table with each members contributions
  - Columns: member, contribution, started, completed, if not completed by same member, who was it completed by...

Recording
- [ ] provide a 8-12 minute code analysis (>12 minutes will result in loss of credit)
- [ ] describe the different aspects of your code: how it works and how your group concluded on your implementations
- [ ] compile your code demonstrating a working prototype using all possible function/method calls and outputs
- [ ] inputs/outputs: exemplify the use of three different data sets showing variation and proving the program works under various entry conditions

Datasets
- [ ] Include a mock dataset for each group member
  - *Note: hardcoding datasets is allowed as the use of databases is not required/desired for this project.*
- [ ] Use only knowledge learned prior to and outside of CSC 212
- [ ] Required Structures
- [ ] Your program must implement `Class` structures and use `vectors` over `arrays`

## Submission

All submissions will be completed through Gradescope. Submissions must adhere to all stated requirements to recieve credit.

The following information must be found in your _primary_ github repository to receive any credit:

1. Program
- [ ] successful compilation of data for each member, respectively
- [ ] required viewable outputs as documented
- [ ] files (at minimum the following, or break it out further)
  - main.cpp
  - gradebook.cpp
  - gradebook.h
2. Documentation
- [ ] `README.md`
  - summary
  - planning
  - compilation instructions
  - runtime instructions
  - sample input/output screenshots with brief explanations of the images used
3. Walkthrough
- [ ] recorded walkthrough
4. Datasets
- [ ] mock data for each member  


## Grading

Point distribution will be determined based on precision and accuracy of each requirement listed within. 

| | What | Importance |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Correctness | Does the application meet all the requirements? | do you understand how to read requirements<br>do you know how to assess a problem and make `reasonable` assumptions<br>can you create from implementable use cases |
| Completeness | Compiles successfully [doe not error out]? If not, how many requirements were met that work? | changing jobs or moving to a new project and `hitting the ground running` |
| Accuracy | How close are the expected outcomes to the actual outcomes? | staying employed<br>keeping your sanity |
| Precision | How consistent are your results? | repeatability<br>reusability |
