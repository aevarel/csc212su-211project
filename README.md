## Project Requirements


## Requirements
An effective output will provide merely a course grade calculated based on all possible points that can be earned within the course.
Program
- [ ] Write a program to successfully evaluate individual deliverables from CSC 212 to provide an accurate output of semester course grades. Viewable outputs should include:
- [ ] individual: returns an individual deliverable name and grade
      - get deliverable object
      - return name, and grade
     some possible variables^^^
      
- [ ] category: returns all grades from the category and category total
     get category
      - probably a vector<deliverables> 
      - initialize a category of each type at runtime 
- [ ] course: ability to return each of the following:
  - all grades within their respective categories and a course overall
  - only category totals and course overall
  - only the course overall
  
  // since all the grades operate off of a point basis, we can set the 
- [ ] clear, conscientious comments embedded within the your code
- [ ] successfully compiles accurate output
- [ ] use read input to take in grades from an external file
- [ ] use write output to write any changes back to your input file

#### input format
  // this is a sample, let's just say the input just comes into this form since the professor says we can be flexible
    // if course points exceed category limits, ask user if there is bonus credit, but floor the final grade to 1000

## Class Structure

#### Gradebook
vector<grade>
vector<grade> 

#### Category 
  
#### Grade 
// this can be an object that contains all of the information associated with the course deliverable 
// 
- Deliverable Name 
-  


#### Student is a Gradebook (Student::Gradebook)
